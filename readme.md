## Description:
ML-based implementation of a popular board game that revolves around connecting player's chips in a neat row of four. Features:

- Minimalist interface for distraction-free gameplay
- Two-player mode
- Single-player mode against a machine learning trained opponent
- User preservation of statistics and save files in a local database
- Pausing current game for later continuation
- Simplified guide for new players.

## Technology Stack:

- Python
- Pyglet
- PyTorch
- SciPy stack
- OpenAI Gym
- SQLite

## Iterations Outline:

1. 30.04 - 06.05:

   Technology research and code structure planning

2. 07.05 - 13.05 

   Initial GUI and application logic, continued technology research

3. 14.05 - 20.05 

   Basic code for AI opponent

   GUI finishing touches 

4. 21.05 - 27.05 

   ML method choice and attempts at implementing AI-players

5. 28.05 - 06.05

   Finishing the AI part of the project
